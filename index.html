                    <p class="info-aboutme mx-auto">Growing up I always knew I wanted to pursue a creative career, art
                        was my favourite subject in school and I didn’t find anything else interesting.
                        However I was bullied when I was 12 and from there I struggled with my self-confidence and
                        self-esteem. When it came to deciding on what I wanted to pursue in the future I made those
                        decision based on what will make my parents proud rather than what am I passionate about. I went
                        to university to study pharmacology and I graduated with a first class honours and then pursued
                        a maters in toxicology a year later.
                    </p>


                    <p class="info-aboutme mx-auto">Before graduating with my masters I gave birth to my son. This is
                        when everything changed, the time I spent at home raising my son was also the time I spent going
                        through a process of self-healing and rebuilding myself. Healing from the trauma I experienced
                        as a child. This completely changed my life, I made a decision to start over and start making
                        decisions for me and my biggest motivation was my son.</p>

                    <p class="info-aboutme mx-auto">I set out on a mission to figure out what I want to do and set
                        myself a deadline to figure it out before my son starts full time school.
                        At first I didn’t know what I was looking for but I kept researching and taking on whatever
                        opportunity I could find, one of the projects I started working on involved using photoshop and
                        from there I began learning how to use it, I started putting my designs on instagram and got
                        some work out of it. For the past two years I have been designing logos, wedding invitations,
                        menus, banners, stickers, personalised mugs and bags. I also developed a passion for
                        calligraphy, with this skill I make handwritten welcome signs for events, and personalised
                        cards. From this experience I realised one of the effective ways to learn is to jump right in
                        and to not be afraid of making mistakes because they are your best lessons. I built a small
                        business around my skills which is growing with time. </p>


                    <p class="info-aboutme mx-auto">Learning to code was a thought I never entertained simply because I
                        just didn’t think I could do it, but with the experience I gained in the last few years I
                        realised I could do anything I set my mind to. I learnt some of the basics of html and css last
                        year and was amazed with what could be done with learning different computer languages. I am
                        super excited to pursue a career in this field and combine it with my creative skills. </p>
